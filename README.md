# SQL-Project

The purpose of this project was to answer questions given to me by my trainer and use what I have learnt in SQL to answer them.
One task was to find the number of cities in the USA from a database and the image below shows my answer of 274 and a few examples:

Another task was to find the number of cities and their populations that have names that begin with 'Be' in the database:

Finally, I was asked to find country with the lowest life expectancy and I used a order by function to answer it. 
The answer is Andorra with a life expectancy of 83.5
